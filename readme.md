# Simple RESS
Is a simple PHP-and-cookies based solution to adapt _pieces_ of your web site's content depending on the user's device screen width.

## Benefits
* Allows for a more highly configurable responsive design
* Provides the flexibility for custom page elements without the drawbacks of a devoted "mobile" site
* Provides a fallback for devices with JavaScript disabled


## Credit
RESS was originally suggested by lukew in [RESS: Responsive Design + Server Side Components](http://www.lukew.com/ff/entry.asp?1392), and uses the screen width cookie from MattWilcox's [Adaptive Images](http://adaptive-images.com/).
